## About
> 19 is a coding school based in Belgium, following the unique pedagogical approach of the 42 Network. It is a peer-to-peer, project-based learning environment with no teachers or traditional classes. Instead, students are encouraged to learn through collaboration, self-study, and hands-on coding projects

**About the 42 Network**

> 42 Network is a global network of coding schools recognized for its revolutionary approach to software engineering education. The network operates over 40 campuses worldwide, providing students with a self-paced, project-based curriculum.
