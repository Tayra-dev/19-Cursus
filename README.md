## :speech_balloon: About
To enter 19 School, I had to pass a one-month entry test called <a href="https://github.com/Tayra46/Piscine19">the Piscine</a>
> 19 is a coding school based in Belgium, following the unique pedagogical approach of the 42 Network. It is a peer-to-peer, project-based learning environment with no teachers or traditional classes. Instead, students are encouraged to learn through collaboration, self-study, and hands-on coding projects

**About the 42 Network**

> 42 Network is a global network of coding schools recognized for its revolutionary approach to software engineering education. The network operates over 40 campuses worldwide, providing students with a self-paced, project-based curriculum.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Skills in development

As I progress through the curriculum, I am developing both technical and interpersonal skills that are essential to be an effective software engineer.\
</br>
**Hard skills**
```bash
Algorithms and Data Structures:
  # Learning to design and implement efficient solutions to complex problems.
Low-level Programming:
  # Developing C programming skills, including memory management and systems programming.
Version Control:
  # Mastering Git version control tools, including branching, merging, and collaborative workflows.
Shell scripting:
  # Gaining in-depth knowledge of the UNIX environment, from shell scripting to process management.
```
</br>

**Soft skills**
```bash
Peer Learning and Collaboration:
  # Building communication and teamwork skills through peer code reviews,
  # group projects, and problem-solving alongside my fellow students.
Self-learning and Autonomy:
  # Developing the ability to learn independently and manage my own progress
  # through challenging projects without formal guidance.
Problem Solving and Adaptability:
  # Strengthening my ability to adapt to new problems and technologies,
  # approaching challenges with creativity and resilience.
Time Management:
  # Learning how to prioritize tasks and manage project deadlines effectively
  # into a self-paced environment.
